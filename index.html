<p>This site is dedicated to some of my favorite Metroid games that have come out since its release back in 1985. WIth this website you will be able to navigate between these games and how they look and a little about each game in it's own deciated page. There were many to choose from, but I decided on each and every one of them based on how much I have played every single game. Not only that it came down to which games I hold closer to my heart due to which ones I acquired as I was growing up.</p>

<p>Metroid was originally released back in 1985. The first game in the series was just called Metroid. It was a mix of two hit Nintendo games that came out before it. Those games were Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. Metroid was created from bits and pieces of these two games that came before it and went on to become just as successful as these games. It is both action and exploration with a huge emphasis on the exploration part. You will never grow tired of playing these games just due to the fact that they have so many different things you can find so many secrets to explore. You control Samus Aran as you travel around planets and take down many foes such as the head boss Mother Brain with her commanders and space pirates. Armed with her Varia Suit she takes off to a new adventure as she takes down the evil space pirates and a stop to the Mother Brain.</p>
