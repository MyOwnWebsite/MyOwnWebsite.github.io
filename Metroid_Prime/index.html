<p>
Metroid Prime came out at the same time as Metroid Fusion which came out in November 17th 2002. It was the first Metroid game to ever be released in 3-D. Now this one is also one of my favorites because even though Metroid Fusion was the first that I ever played Metroid Prime was the one that exposed me to the Metroid series to begin with. My brother was the one who had the game at the time it came out and I would stand by as he would play it. I got engaged into a game that was unlike any that I had seen at the time. I was part of the game even though I didnâ€™t play it at first.
