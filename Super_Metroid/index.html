<p>Super Metroid came out in 1994. Two years after I was born and too long ago that I never heard of it until way into my teenage years. This game is considered by many as one of the greatest Metroid games that have come out to date. I always heard this, but never understood why until I experienced it for myself. It was just amazing. I have no words to describe this classic game that was loved by many all over the world. I do have one thing to say about this game though, sometimes I wish I had been old enough when the game first came out so I had been able to experience with so many other people back then. Back when it was at the top of its game.</p>
